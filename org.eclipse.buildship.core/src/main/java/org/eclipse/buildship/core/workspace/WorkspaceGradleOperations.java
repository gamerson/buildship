     * <ol>
     * <li>the Gradle nature is removed</li>
     * <li>the derived resource markers are removed</li>
     * <li>the Gradle settings file is removed</li>
     * </ol>
     * </li>
     * <li>Synchronize all Gradle projects of the Gradle build with the Eclipse workspace project counterparts:
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * If there is a project in the workspace at the location of the Gradle project, the synchronization is as follows:
     * <ol>
     * <li>If the workspace project is closed, the project is left unchanged</li>
     * <li>If the workspace project is open:
     * <ul>
     * <li>the project name is updated</li>
     * <li>the Gradle nature is set</li>
     * <li>the Gradle settings file is written</li>
     * <li>the linked resources are set</li>
     * <li>the derived resources are marked</li>
     * <li>the project natures and build commands are set</li>
     * <li>if the Gradle project is a Java project
     * <ul>
     * <li>the Java nature is added </li>
     * <li>the source compatibility settings are updated</li>
     * <li>the set of source folders is updated</li>
     * <li>the Gradle classpath container is updated</li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * </ol>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * If there is an Eclipse project at the location of the Gradle project, i.e. there is a .project file in that folder, then
     * the {@link NewProjectHandler} decides whether to import it and whether to keep or overwrite that existing .project file.
     * The imported project is then synchronized as specified above.
     * </li>
     * <li>If the there is no project in the workspace, nor an Eclipse project at the location of the Gradle build,
     * then the {@link NewProjectHandler} decides whether to import it.
     * The imported project is then synchronized as specified above.
